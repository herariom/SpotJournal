# SpotJournal

## Idea
SpotJournal is a daily journal application where users can record their daily lives and feelings by comparing their emotional state before and after listening to a familiar but random song pulled from their Spotify account. After submitting their reaction to the song, they can view how others have reacted to the same song. Users also have access to the full features you would expect any journal to have.

## Implementation
Our backend is implemented in Python Flask to get information about the user from the Spotify Web API and any user responses are stored on MySQL databases. Our web appâ€™s frontend is produced from HTML generated by our Flask application, and the whole project is hosted and deployed on Google Cloud.

## Notes
Currently the journal search functionality of the program is not implemented
